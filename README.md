## **UX (User Experience)** ##
### **Project Summary** ###
The main purpose of this project is to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset.
By authenticating on the site and paying for some of its services, users can advance their own goals. Before authenticating, the site makes it clear how those goals would be furthered by the site.
The site owner is able to make money by providing this set of services to the users. There is no way for a regular user to bypass the site's mechanisms and derive all of the value available to paid users without paying.
### **User Stories**

  - I want to be able to easily view the total of my purchases at any time, so that I can avoid spending too much.

- **Sorting and Searching**
  - I want to be able to sort the list of availabe products, so that I can easily identify the best rated, best priced and categorically sorted products.
  - I want to be able to sort a specific category of product, so that I can find the best priced or best rated product in a specific category, or sort the products in that category name.
  - I want to be able to sort multiple categories of products simultaneously, so that I can find the best priced or best rated products accross broad categories such as "Clothing" or "Homeware".

  - I want to be able to easily see what I've searched for and the number of results, so that I can quickly decide wheather the product I want is availabe.

- **Purchasing and Checkout**
  - I want to be able to easily select the size and quantity of a product when purchasing it, so that I can ensure I don't accidentally select the wrong product, auantity or size.

#### **As a Site Users**

- **Registeration and User Account**

<!-- #### **As an Admin User**
  - I want to be able to delete the unrelated or spams from the recipes.
    - I have achieved this by creating a loop over all delete buttons on all recipes specialized for the admin. Other users can edit or delete only their own recipes.
  - I want to be able to edit or delete the recipes that are added by myself.
    - I have achived this by providing the edit and delete button on the collapsible header of these recipes in admin profile page. Delete btn moved to the head on the collapsible body in mobile viewdevices.
  - I want to be able to manage the categories and marks for the recipes.
    - I have achived this by making 2 seperated pages for the admin to go through all the categories and marks and add, edit or delete each on on them. -->

### **Design choices**

  The goal in design was to create a website that is overall user friendly, has a modern feel with emphasis on providing information about recipes in a readable and eye-catching way. Therefore, following design choices were made:
- **Framework**
  * Front-end framework, [Bootstrap](https://Bootstrap.com/),  based on bootstrap Design was chosen for this project for its modern interface and ease of use.

  * [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was used for initializing some bootstrap elements.
  * Micro framework [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), was chosen to build the backend.
- **Typography**
  - I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:ital@1&family=Yusei+Magic&display=swap") for the font style of my project:
    - The font I have used for the body of this project is called **Montserrat** and for the headers, input and labels I used **Yusei Magic** font with sans-serif as a backup font.

- **Icons**
  - I used [Favicon](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/favicon/) to make a unic brand for my website.
  - I used [FontAwesome]() as the main icon library across the project (e.g. for forms and buttons).

- **Colour Scheme**

  The idea of using different shades of the same colour is implemented accross the website. The primary colour used for main buttons and headings is deep purple as it seems to create a nice contrast with white backgrounds. The secondary colour used for icons, dividers and some other buttons is blue and pink.

  - **Main colour palette**

    - #5e35b1 deep-purple darken-1 used for navbar, collapsible header flash text and add buttons.
    - #7e57c2 deep-purple lighten-1 used for hover effect on navbar and add buttons.
    - #d81b60 pink darken-1 used for reset, delete and cancel buttons and some info texts.
    - #ad1457 pink darken-3 used for hover effect on reset, delete and cancel buttons.
    - #2979ff blue accent-3 used for edit buttons.
    - #2962ff blue accent-4 used for hover effect on edit buttons.

## **Technologies**
- **Front-End**

  - [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
    - To give the page its structure and presenting static data.
    - All HTML files are located within the 'templates' directory.
  - [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    - CSS has been used to style and customise the content of this project.
  - [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
    - This is a framework that I have used to simplify CSS classes, features that have been used and modified include the navbar, responsive design classes, and colors for backgrounds and text.
  - [JQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery)
    - JQuery has been used to give the site its functionality as well as making DOM manipulation simpler.

- **Back-end**
  - [MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB) 
    - As the data entered by users can always be different from one to the next, the project uses MongoDB to store its data as MongoDB is a Document Based Database.
  - [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework))
    - Flask is a framework that allows developers to easily present data in an orderly fashion. All data entered by a user, such as the Recipe Name, is presented to users with a few lines of code embedded into the HTML.
      - Modules from Flask that have been included are:
      - Flask
      - flash
      - render_template
      - redirect
      - request
      - session
      - url_for
      - PyMongo
  - [bson.objectid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bson-objectid)
      - ObjectId
  - [werkzeug.security](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/utils/)
      - generate_password_hash
      - check_password_hash
  - [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
      - datetime
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/)
    - Python is working very closely with Flask to manipulate data and HTML across multiple pages within the app.
- **Deployment**
  * [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * [Github](https://github.com/)
  * [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)
- **validators**
  - The validators that have been used on the project are as followed:
    - [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) - No issues apart from jinja templating
    - [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - No issues
    - [JavaScript Validator](https://jshint.com/) - No issues

## **Fixed Issues**

- **Issue 1** - When a user were adding a recipe with empty lines in multi-line textarea inputs, empty lines were shown in these areas.
  - I fixed this issue by adding the above script.js file to trim the empty lines.

```$('li, .edit-delete-div').filter(function () {
        return $(this).text().trim() === '';}).remove();
```
- **Issue 2** - When editing a recipe user could add the marks that they have chosen for this recipe from before, again, in the dropdown list.
  - I fixed this issue by adding the above edit.js file code to avoid duplication.
```$(document).ready(function () {
var marks = document.getElementById("mark");

[].slice.call(marks.options)
  .map(function(a){
    if(this[a.value]){ 
      marks.removeChild(a); 
    } else { 
      this[a.value]=1; 
    } 
  },{});
});
```
- **Issue 3** - Users could open unauthorized pages if providing it's url route path in the browser.

  - I fixed this problem with adding error handlers in my python and using relative error conditions in the functions that needed like manage, add, edit and delete categories and mark pages, users profile page, add, edit and delete buttons. These codes are provided with docstrings in my [app.py](app.py) in more details.
```
@app.errorhandler(404)
def page_not_found(e):
    return render_template('404.html'), 404


@app.errorhandler(500)
def internal_server_error(e):
    return render_template('500.html'), 500


@app.errorhandler(403)
def page_forbidden(e):
    return render_template('403.html'), 500
```
- **Issue 4** - The title areas for category and marks where changing height depending on their html note.
    - I fixed this issue with adding the code below to my script.js file
```
    var manageTitleHight = 0;

$(".manage-title").each(function(){
   if ($(this).height() > manageTitleHight) { manageTitleHight = $(this).height(); }
});

$(".manage-title").height(manageTitleHight);
   // to avoid copying the link of the delete and edit btns
$(".delete-btn, .edit-btn").contextmenu(function () { return false; });
});
```
- **Issue 5** - By putting some recipe informations with both edit and delete buttons in the recipes collapsible header, mas not a good choice for smaller views.
  - I fixed that issue by using some materialize classes to replace dome of these info in the body of the collapsible in smaller views.
```
This class is in the collapsible header and hide this buttton in small views.
 <a href="{{ url_for('delete_recipe', recipe_id=recipe._id) }}"
 class="btn-small delete-btn hide-on-small-only">Delete</a>

This class is in the collapsible body and hide this buttton in medium and large views.
 <a href="{{ url_for('delete_recipe', recipe_id=recipe._id) }}"
class="btn-small delete-btn hide-on-med-and-up -align">Delete Recipe</a>
```
